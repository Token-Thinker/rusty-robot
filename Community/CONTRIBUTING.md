# Contributing to Rusty Robot

Rusty Robot welcomes contribution from everyone in the form of suggestions, bug
reports, pull requests, and feedback. This document gives some guidance if you
are thinking of helping us.

## Submitting bug reports and feature requests

When reporting a bug or asking for help, please include enough details so that
the people helping you can reproduce the behavior you are seeing. For some tips
on how to approach this, read about how to produce a [Minimal, Complete, and
Verifiable example].

When making a feature request, please make it clear what problem you intend to
solve with the feature, any ideas for how Serde could support solving that
problem, any possible alternatives, and any disadvantages.
